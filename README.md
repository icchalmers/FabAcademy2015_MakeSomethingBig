# FabAcademy2015_MakeSomethingBig

This is my implementation and modification of the [AtFAB One To Several Table](http://atfab.co/?portfolio=one-to-several-table). The table was modelled in Autodesk Inventor. The model is pretty well parameterised so you can modify the design to your own needs by editing the values in TableParams.xlsx.

The table was made as part [Fab Academy 2015](http://www.fabacademy.org/) at [Fab Lab Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/fablab/). It was cut at [MakLab](http://www.maklab.co.uk/) on an 8'x4' CNC machine. You can follow my progress on [my class website](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/chalmers.iain/index.html). The content is also mirrored to [my GitHub Pages site](http://icchalmers.github.io/).
